The following are the applications of the proposed framework:

\begin{itemize}
    \item This framework can be used to help government and police to prevent crimes
    before they happen. This reduces lot of costs that would be included in 
    case-handling.
    \item This framework can be extended to forecast other urban data like 
    recession. Only the input data like the crime matrix would change. Given
    the historical data corresponding to the data to be forecasted, the framework
    can be used in the same way as in predicting crimes.
\end{itemize}
